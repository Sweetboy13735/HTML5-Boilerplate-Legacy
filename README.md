This repository is responsible for managing my custom HTML5 Boilerplate, forked from [the official HTML5 Boilerplate repo](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

## Support
If you encounter any issues with the boilerplate, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/HTML5-Boilerplate/issues) (Provided it hasn't been logged already) or [E-mail me](mailto:ramonegraham@gmail.com), describing fully what the problem is.

## Roadmap
Throughout this project's development, I'll be using the [Git Flow](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:cc0b526e-adb7-4d45-874e-9bcea9898b4a/04%20Hotfix%20branches.svg?cdnVersion=140) branching method to keep track of all changes.

## [Contributing](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/HTML5-Boilerplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
As this is my own boilerplate, I'm looking to do most of the heavy-lifting myself, but I am open to small contributions. Please check out the link above for more info.
